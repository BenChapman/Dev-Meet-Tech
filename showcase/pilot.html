              The Dev, meet Tech pilot event was run as a one day event on Saturday 22nd August 2015. For this event, <strong>18 student change makers</strong> came together on a summer Saturday from a diverse range of backgrounds to develop new ways to use technology for good.
            </p>

            <p>
              We also had <strong>6 mentors</strong> to help guide the teams in their developments and <strong>3 fantastic speakers</strong> to help set the scene for the day in our morning speaker series. After the speaker series, the cohort was split into groups and sent on their way to get developing.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>And their results were insanely cool.</strong>

              <p>
                Technology is all around us, after all. In a larger, high level perspective, Dev, meet Tech was organized by us due to the current situation in the tech scene: we're not often exposed to the <strong>power that technology</strong> can have to provoke real positive social change. We realised that technology can be used to do good by anybody. All that's required is an innovative mind and some basic tech skills. From this we spawned the idea of <strong>Dev, meet Tech</strong>.

              <p>
                <strong>40%</strong> of the cohort were non-tech students. This provided the teams on the day with lots a <strong>different outlooks</strong> to problems and how technology can be used to tackle them. We had a selection of <strong>business, poltics and art students</strong>, as well as tech students, who all brought their own skillsets and views on all kinds of issues in todays world.

              <p>
                For Dev, meet Tech, we tried to move away from traditional hackathon concepts (we even avoid using the word ”hackathon” because of its baggage). We did however still use regular ”hacking food”, like <strong>pizza and beer :)</strong> In the morning we held a <strong>speaker series</strong> made up of three fantastic speakers who all provided the cohort with food for thought to set them up for the rest of the day.

              <p>
                “It wasn't like a 'typical' hackathon, it was more than that.”
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              We have now showed for ourselves and the attendees of Dev, meet Tech that our hypothesis holds:
            </p>

            <p class="highlight">
              Students can make a real difference using technology
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Technology can empower anyone</strong> to provoke a positive change in this world. We hope to awaken students to this power and how it can be utilised for good.
